# BMI Calculator

A simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using Python and Tkinter for a graphical user interface (GUI). The BMI Calculator allows users to enter their weight and height, and calculates their BMI to determine their weight category.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use GUI**: The BMI Calculator has a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily input their height and weight.
- **BMI Calculation**: The calculator computes BMI based on the formula:
  \[
  BMI = \frac{weight \, (kg)}{height^2 \, (m^2)}
  \]
- **Categorized Results**: Displays the BMI category (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese) based on the calculated BMI.
- **Unit Conversion**: Optionally supports height and weight in different units (meters, centimeters, inches, kilograms, pounds).
